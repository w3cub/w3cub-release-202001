extends Enum&lt;ChronoField&gt;
implements TemporalField</pre> <div>
<p>A standard set of fields. </p>
<p> This set of fields provide field-based access to manipulate a date, time or date-time. The standard set of fields can be extended by implementing <a href="../temporalfield/"><code>TemporalField</code></a>. </p>
<p> These fields are intended to be applicable in multiple calendar systems. For example, most non-ISO calendar systems define dates as a year, month and day, just with slightly different rules. The documentation of each field explains how it operates.</p>
</div> <dl> <dt>Implementation Requirements:</dt> <dd>This is a final, immutable and thread-safe enum.</dd> <dt>Since:</dt> <dd>1.8</dd> </dl>       <h2 id="enum.constant.detail">Enum Constants</h2>   <h3 id="NANO_OF_SECOND">NANO_OF_SECOND</h3> <pre data-language="java">public static final ChronoField NANO_OF_SECOND</pre> <div>
<p>The nano-of-second. </p>
<p> This counts the nanosecond within the second, from 0 to 999,999,999. This field has the same meaning for all calendar systems. </p>
<p> This field is used to represent the nano-of-second handling any fraction of the second. Implementations of <code>TemporalAccessor</code> should provide a value for this field if they can return a value for <a href="../chronofield/#SECOND_OF_MINUTE"><code>SECOND_OF_MINUTE</code></a>, <a href="../chronofield/#SECOND_OF_DAY"><code>SECOND_OF_DAY</code></a> or <a href="../chronofield/#INSTANT_SECONDS"><code>INSTANT_SECONDS</code></a> filling unknown precision with zero. </p>
<p> When this field is used for setting a value, it should set as much precision as the object stores, using integer division to remove excess precision. For example, if the <code>TemporalAccessor</code> stores time to millisecond precision, then the nano-of-second must be divided by 1,000,000 before replacing the milli-of-second. </p>
<p> When parsing this field it behaves equivalent to the following: The value is validated in strict and smart mode but not in lenient mode. The field is resolved in combination with <code>MILLI_OF_SECOND</code> and <code>MICRO_OF_SECOND</code>.</p>

<p> This field is used to represent the micro-of-second handling any fraction of the second. Implementations of <code>TemporalAccessor</code> should provide a value for this field if they can return a value for <a href="../chronofield/#SECOND_OF_MINUTE"><code>SECOND_OF_MINUTE</code></a>, <a href="../chronofield/#SECOND_OF_DAY"><code>SECOND_OF_DAY</code></a> or <a href="../chronofield/#INSTANT_SECONDS"><code>INSTANT_SECONDS</code></a> filling unknown precision with zero. </p>
<p> When this field is used for setting a value, it should behave in the same way as setting <a href="../chronofield/#NANO_OF_SECOND"><code>NANO_OF_SECOND</code></a> with the value multiplied by 1,000. </p>
<p> When parsing this field it behaves equivalent to the following: The value is validated in strict and smart mode but not in lenient mode. The field is resolved in combination with <code>MILLI_OF_SECOND</code> to produce <code>NANO_OF_SECOND</code>.</p>

<p>The clock-hour-of-am-pm. </p>
<p> This counts the hour within the AM/PM, from 1 to 12. This is the hour that would be observed on a standard 12-hour analog wall clock. This field has the same meaning for all calendar systems. </p>
<p> When parsing this field it behaves equivalent to the following: The value is validated from 1 to 12 in strict mode and from 0 to 12 in smart mode. In lenient mode the value is not validated. The field is converted to an <code>HOUR_OF_AMPM</code> with the same value, unless the value is 12, in which case it is converted to 0.</p>
</div>    <h3 id="HOUR_OF_DAY">HOUR_OF_DAY</h3> <pre data-language="java">public static final ChronoField HOUR_OF_DAY</pre> <div>
<p>The hour-of-day. </p>

<p> When parsing this field it behaves equivalent to the following: The value is validated in strict and smart mode but not in lenient mode. The field is combined with <code>MINUTE_OF_HOUR</code>, <code>SECOND_OF_MINUTE</code> and <code>NANO_OF_SECOND</code> to produce a <code>LocalTime</code>. In lenient mode, any excess days are added to the parsed date, or made available via <a href="../../format/datetimeformatter/#parsedExcessDays--"><code>DateTimeFormatter.parsedExcessDays()</code></a>.</p>
</div>    <h3 id="CLOCK_HOUR_OF_DAY">CLOCK_HOUR_OF_DAY</h3> <pre data-language="java">public static final ChronoField CLOCK_HOUR_OF_DAY</pre> <div>
<p>The clock-hour-of-day. </p>
<p> This counts the hour within the AM/PM, from 1 to 24. This is the hour that would be observed on a 24-hour analog wall clock. This field has the same meaning for all calendar systems. </p>
<p> When parsing this field it behaves equivalent to the following: The value is validated from 1 to 24 in strict mode and from 0 to 24 in smart mode. In lenient mode the value is not validated.

<p>The am-pm-of-day. </p>
<p> This counts the AM/PM within the day, from 0 (AM) to 1 (PM). This field has the same meaning for all calendar systems. </p>
<p> When parsing this field it behaves equivalent to the following: The value is validated from 0 to 1 in strict and smart mode. In lenient mode the value is not validated. It is combined with <code>HOUR_OF_AMPM</code> to form <code>HOUR_OF_DAY</code> by multiplying the {AMPM_OF_DAY} value by 12.</p>
</div>    <h3 id="DAY_OF_WEEK">DAY_OF_WEEK</h3> <pre data-language="java">public static final ChronoField DAY_OF_WEEK</pre> <div>
<p>The day-of-week, such as Tuesday. </p>
<p> This represents the standard concept of the day of the week. In the default ISO calendar system, this has values from Monday (1) to Sunday (7). The <a href="../../dayofweek/"><code>DayOfWeek</code></a> class can be used to interpret the result. </p>
<p> Most non-ISO calendar systems also define a seven day week that aligns with ISO. Those calendar systems must also use the same numbering system, from Monday (1) to Sunday (7), which allows <code>DayOfWeek</code> to be used. </p>
<p> Calendar systems that do not have a standard seven day week should implement this field if they have a similar concept of named or numbered days within a period similar to a week. It is recommended that the numbering starts from 1.</p>
</div>    <h3 id="ALIGNED_DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_MONTH">ALIGNED_DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_MONTH</h3> <pre data-language="java">public static final ChronoField ALIGNED_DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_MONTH</pre> <div>
<p>The aligned day-of-week within a month. </p>
<p> This represents concept of the count of days within the period of a week where the weeks are aligned to the start of the month. This field is typically used with <a href="../chronofield/#ALIGNED_WEEK_OF_MONTH"><code>ALIGNED_WEEK_OF_MONTH</code></a>. </p>
<p> For example, in a calendar systems with a seven day week, the first aligned-week-of-month starts on day-of-month 1, the second aligned-week starts on day-of-month 8, and so on. Within each of these aligned-weeks, the days are numbered from 1 to 7 and returned as the value of this field. As such, day-of-month 1 to 7 will have aligned-day-of-week values from 1 to 7. And day-of-month 8 to 14 will repeat this with aligned-day-of-week values from 1 to 7. </p>
<p> Calendar systems that do not have a seven day week should typically implement this field in the same way, but using the alternate week length.</p>
</div>    <h3 id="ALIGNED_DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_YEAR">ALIGNED_DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_YEAR</h3> <pre data-language="java">public static final ChronoField ALIGNED_DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_YEAR</pre> <div>
<p>The aligned day-of-week within a year. </p>
<p> This represents concept of the count of days within the period of a week where the weeks are aligned to the start of the year. This field is typically used with <a href="../chronofield/#ALIGNED_WEEK_OF_YEAR"><code>ALIGNED_WEEK_OF_YEAR</code></a>. </p>
<p> For example, in a calendar systems with a seven day week, the first aligned-week-of-year starts on day-of-year 1, the second aligned-week starts on day-of-year 8, and so on. Within each of these aligned-weeks, the days are numbered from 1 to 7 and returned as the value of this field. As such, day-of-year 1 to 7 will have aligned-day-of-week values from 1 to 7. And day-of-year 8 to 14 will repeat this with aligned-day-of-week values from 1 to 7. </p>
<p> Calendar systems that do not have a seven day week should typically implement this field in the same way, but using the alternate week length.</p>
</div>    <h3 id="DAY_OF_MONTH">DAY_OF_MONTH</h3> <pre data-language="java">public static final ChronoField DAY_OF_MONTH</pre> <div>
<p>The day-of-month. </p>
<p> This represents the concept of the day within the month. In the default ISO calendar system, this has values from 1 to 31 in most months. April, June, September, November have days from 1 to 30, while February has days from 1 to 28, or 29 in a leap year. </p>
<p> Non-ISO calendar systems should implement this field using the most recognized day-of-month values for users of the calendar system. Normally, this is a count of days from 1 to the length of the month.</p>
</div>    <h3 id="DAY_OF_YEAR">DAY_OF_YEAR</h3> <pre data-language="java">public static final ChronoField DAY_OF_YEAR</pre> <div>
<p>The day-of-year. </p>
<p> This represents the concept of the day within the year. In the default ISO calendar system, this has values from 1 to 365 in standard years and 1 to 366 in leap years. </p>
<p> Non-ISO calendar systems should implement this field using the most recognized day-of-year values for users of the calendar system. Normally, this is a count of days from 1 to the length of the year. </p>
<p> Note that a non-ISO calendar system may have year numbering system that changes at a different point to the natural reset in the month numbering. An example of this is the Japanese calendar system where a change of era, which resets the year number to 1, can happen on any date. The era and year reset also cause the day-of-year to be reset to 1, but not the month-of-year or day-of-month.</p>
</div>    <h3 id="EPOCH_DAY">EPOCH_DAY</h3> <pre data-language="java">public static final ChronoField EPOCH_DAY</pre> <div>
<p>The epoch-day, based on the Java epoch of 1970-01-01 (ISO). </p>
<p> This field is the sequential count of days where 1970-01-01 (ISO) is zero. Note that this uses the <i>local</i> time-line, ignoring offset and time-zone. </p>
<p> This field is strictly defined to have the same meaning in all calendar systems. This is necessary to ensure interoperation between calendars.</p>
</div>    <h3 id="ALIGNED_WEEK_OF_MONTH">ALIGNED_WEEK_OF_MONTH</h3> <pre data-language="java">public static final ChronoField ALIGNED_WEEK_OF_MONTH</pre> <div>
<p>The aligned week within a month. </p>
<p> This represents concept of the count of weeks within the period of a month where the weeks are aligned to the start of the month. This field is typically used with <a href="../chronofield/#ALIGNED_DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_MONTH"><code>ALIGNED_DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_MONTH</code></a>. </p>
<p> For example, in a calendar systems with a seven day week, the first aligned-week-of-month starts on day-of-month 1, the second aligned-week starts on day-of-month 8, and so on. Thus, day-of-month values 1 to 7 are in aligned-week 1, while day-of-month values 8 to 14 are in aligned-week 2, and so on. </p>
<p> Calendar systems that do not have a seven day week should typically implement this field in the same way, but using the alternate week length.</p>
</div>    <h3 id="ALIGNED_WEEK_OF_YEAR">ALIGNED_WEEK_OF_YEAR</h3> <pre data-language="java">public static final ChronoField ALIGNED_WEEK_OF_YEAR</pre> <div>
<p>The aligned week within a year. </p>
<p> This represents concept of the count of weeks within the period of a year where the weeks are aligned to the start of the year. This field is typically used with <a href="../chronofield/#ALIGNED_DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_YEAR"><code>ALIGNED_DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_YEAR</code></a>. </p>
<p> For example, in a calendar systems with a seven day week, the first aligned-week-of-year starts on day-of-year 1, the second aligned-week starts on day-of-year 8, and so on. Thus, day-of-year values 1 to 7 are in aligned-week 1, while day-of-year values 8 to 14 are in aligned-week 2, and so on. </p>
<p> Calendar systems that do not have a seven day week should typically implement this field in the same way, but using the alternate week length.</p>
</div>    <h3 id="MONTH_OF_YEAR">MONTH_OF_YEAR</h3> <pre data-language="java">public static final ChronoField MONTH_OF_YEAR</pre> <div>
<p>The month-of-year, such as March. </p>
<p> This represents the concept of the month within the year. In the default ISO calendar system, this has values from January (1) to December (12). </p>
<p> Non-ISO calendar systems should implement this field using the most recognized month-of-year values for users of the calendar system. Normally, this is a count of months starting from 1.</p>
</div>    <h3 id="PROLEPTIC_MONTH">PROLEPTIC_MONTH</h3> <pre data-language="java">public static final ChronoField PROLEPTIC_MONTH</pre> <div>
<p>The proleptic-month based, counting months sequentially from year 0. </p>
<p> This field is the sequential count of months where the first month in proleptic-year zero has the value zero. Later months have increasingly larger values. Earlier months have increasingly small values. There are no gaps or breaks in the sequence of months. Note that this uses the <i>local</i> time-line, ignoring offset and time-zone. </p>
<p> In the default ISO calendar system, June 2012 would have the value <code>(2012 * 12 + 6 - 1)</code>. This field is primarily for internal use. </p>
<p> Non-ISO calendar systems must implement this field as per the definition above. It is just a simple zero-based count of elapsed months from the start of proleptic-year 0. All calendar systems with a full proleptic-year definition will have a year zero. If the calendar system has a minimum year that excludes year zero, then one must be extrapolated in order for this method to be defined.</p>
</div>    <h3 id="YEAR_OF_ERA">YEAR_OF_ERA</h3> <pre data-language="java">public static final ChronoField YEAR_OF_ERA</pre> <div>
<p>The year within the era. </p>
<p> This represents the concept of the year within the era. This field is typically used with <a href="../chronofield/#ERA"><code>ERA</code></a>. </p>
<p> The standard mental model for a date is based on three concepts - year, month and day. These map onto the <code>YEAR</code>, <code>MONTH_OF_YEAR</code> and <code>DAY_OF_MONTH</code> fields. Note that there is no reference to eras. The full model for a date requires four concepts - era, year, month and day. These map onto the <code>ERA</code>, <code>YEAR_OF_ERA</code>, <code>MONTH_OF_YEAR</code> and <code>DAY_OF_MONTH</code> fields. Whether this field or <code>YEAR</code> is used depends on which mental model is being used. See <a href="../../chrono/chronolocaldate/"><code>ChronoLocalDate</code></a> for more discussion on this topic. </p>
<p> In the default ISO calendar system, there are two eras defined, 'BCE' and 'CE'. The era 'CE' is the one currently in use and year-of-era runs from 1 to the maximum value. The era 'BCE' is the previous era, and the year-of-era runs backwards. </p>
<p> For example, subtracting a year each time yield the following:<br> - year-proleptic 2 = 'CE' year-of-era 2<br> - year-proleptic 1 = 'CE' year-of-era 1<br> - year-proleptic 0 = 'BCE' year-of-era 1<br> - year-proleptic -1 = 'BCE' year-of-era 2<br> </p>
<p> Note that the ISO-8601 standard does not actually define eras. Note also that the ISO eras do not align with the well-known AD/BC eras due to the change between the Julian and Gregorian calendar systems. </p>
<p> Non-ISO calendar systems should implement this field using the most recognized year-of-era value for users of the calendar system. Since most calendar systems have only two eras, the year-of-era numbering approach will typically be the same as that used by the ISO calendar system. The year-of-era value should typically always be positive, however this is not required.</p>
</div>    <h3 id="YEAR">YEAR</h3> <pre data-language="java">public static final ChronoField YEAR</pre> <div>
<p>The proleptic year, such as 2012. </p>
<p> This represents the concept of the year, counting sequentially and using negative numbers. The proleptic year is not interpreted in terms of the era. See <a href="../chronofield/#YEAR_OF_ERA"><code>YEAR_OF_ERA</code></a> for an example showing the mapping from proleptic year to year-of-era. </p>
<p> The standard mental model for a date is based on three concepts - year, month and day. These map onto the <code>YEAR</code>, <code>MONTH_OF_YEAR</code> and <code>DAY_OF_MONTH</code> fields. Note that there is no reference to eras. The full model for a date requires four concepts - era, year, month and day. These map onto the <code>ERA</code>, <code>YEAR_OF_ERA</code>, <code>MONTH_OF_YEAR</code> and <code>DAY_OF_MONTH</code> fields. Whether this field or <code>YEAR_OF_ERA</code> is used depends on which mental model is being used. See <a href="../../chrono/chronolocaldate/"><code>ChronoLocalDate</code></a> for more discussion on this topic. </p>
<p> Non-ISO calendar systems should implement this field as follows. If the calendar system has only two eras, before and after a fixed date, then the proleptic-year value must be the same as the year-of-era value for the later era, and increasingly negative for the earlier era. If the calendar system has more than two eras, then the proleptic-year value may be defined with any appropriate value, although defining it to be the same as ISO may be the best option.</p>
</div>    <h3 id="ERA">ERA</h3> <pre data-language="java">public static final ChronoField ERA</pre> <div>
<p>The era. </p>
<p> This represents the concept of the era, which is the largest division of the time-line. This field is typically used with <a href="../chronofield/#YEAR_OF_ERA"><code>YEAR_OF_ERA</code></a>. </p>
<p> In the default ISO calendar system, there are two eras defined, 'BCE' and 'CE'. The era 'CE' is the one currently in use and year-of-era runs from 1 to the maximum value. The era 'BCE' is the previous era, and the year-of-era runs backwards. See <a href="../chronofield/#YEAR_OF_ERA"><code>YEAR_OF_ERA</code></a> for a full example. </p>
<p> Non-ISO calendar systems should implement this field to define eras. The value of the era that was active on 1970-01-01 (ISO) must be assigned the value 1. Earlier eras must have sequentially smaller values. Later eras must have sequentially larger values,</p>
</div>    <h3 id="INSTANT_SECONDS">INSTANT_SECONDS</h3> <pre data-language="java">public static final ChronoField INSTANT_SECONDS</pre> <div>
<p>The instant epoch-seconds. </p>
<p> This represents the concept of the sequential count of seconds where 1970-01-01T00:00Z (ISO) is zero. This field may be used with <a href="../chronofield/#NANO_OF_SECOND"><code>NANO_OF_SECOND</code></a> to represent the fraction of the second. </p>
<p> An <a href="../../instant/"><code>Instant</code></a> represents an instantaneous point on the time-line. On their own, an instant has insufficient information to allow a local date-time to be obtained. Only when paired with an offset or time-zone can the local date or time be calculated. </p>
<p> This field is strictly defined to have the same meaning in all calendar systems. This is necessary to ensure interoperation between calendars.</p>
</div>    <h3 id="OFFSET_SECONDS">OFFSET_SECONDS</h3> <pre data-language="java">public static final ChronoField OFFSET_SECONDS</pre> <div>
<p>The offset from UTC/Greenwich. </p>
<p> This represents the concept of the offset in seconds of local time from UTC/Greenwich. </p>
<p> A <a href="../../zoneoffset/"><code>ZoneOffset</code></a> represents the period of time that local time differs from UTC/Greenwich. This is usually a fixed number of hours and minutes. It is equivalent to the <a href="../../zoneoffset/#getTotalSeconds--"><code>total amount</code></a> of the offset in seconds. For example, during the winter Paris has an offset of <code>+01:00</code>, which is 3600 seconds. </p>
